quantum logic gates are reversible

general approach to QC = quantum gates

ordra^5 costed 1 mln$ "cheap", 100mln$ from IBM

it is done via superconductors (most popular, google iqm ibm), such cubit lives 1ms, requires ~0K(in odra 18 microK) temp, also in odra^5
other ion traps , quantum dots (intel, vacum), cold atoms and photonics (room temp! quic)

ibm plans to expand procesor like current parallel processing so another "core" near

10000qbits = crack of rsa in banking as of now

logical qbit = qbit without error

15kW, the other 1MW in wcss

i seems to be cheaper than normal computing

quantum annealing -> using quantum fluctuation and tuneling to determine the best solution to optimisation problem. The problem has to be in form of Hamiltonian (criterion). it works bcs the energy of the system wants to go to lowest energy state. it takes only microseconds no matter the size of the problem, saddly its not deterministic thats why we may use branch and bound scheme here

Dwave adventage computer hac >5000qbits but only for quantum annealing, it cannot create quantum gates

niobium? 
qbits live in microseconds, so the program must be fast
qubo model

its nondeterministic, so we have to repeat it multiple times to got result

quantum turing machine <- BQP problems, solvable by QTM in at most 1/3 probability error

currently bcs of the amount of binary variables we can do at most ~8 cities in traveling salesman problem optimisation
