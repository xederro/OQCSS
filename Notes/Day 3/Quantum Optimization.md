### search in unstructured data
grover's algorithm
|0> H Uf 2|s><s| -1 measurement
initialise (hadaman), oracle, diffusor, measurement

equally probable -> -1 probability on our -> rotate around mean -> we have almost 100% to receive what we are looking for



## Areas

- ml - qml
- finance - portfolio optimization

### optimisation
qc can optimize for combinatorial problems
f.e. reducing waste

optimisation of assembly to minimise downtime of machines

### material science
working with atoms and molecules on the nanoscale, conseving laws of quantum mechanics - electron densities, minimal energy

for example H2O
3 atom cores, 10 electrons

we need 8 qbits to represent the problem

### machine learning
similar to normal machine learning

### finance
prediction of price developement
monte carlo simulation
quantum enables more complex simulations

### breaking cryptography
Factorise integers efficiently
- shor's algorithm

Efficient unstructured search
- grover's algorithm

quantum key distribution
