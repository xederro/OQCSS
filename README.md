Quantum computing is one of the most exciting and fast-evolving fields in modern science and technology. It promises revolutionary breakthroughs in optimization, cryptography, machine learning, materials science, and beyond. However, entering this domain requires a solid foundation in quantum theory, familiarity with emerging hardware platforms, and experience with quantum programming and hybrid algorithms.

Odra - Quantum Summer School is a five-day intensive program designed to guide participants through the theoretical fundamentals and practical applications of quantum computation. From foundational mathematics and physical models, through quantum gate operations and hardware architectures, to optimization algorithms and quantum-enhanced machine learning.

Participants will gain direct insight into the inner workings of leading quantum computing platforms, including gate-based systems (IQM), quantum annealers, and hybrid-classical approaches. Hands-on labs and a final tournament that will allow attendees to experiment with real-world quantum programming challenges and problem-solving strategies.
